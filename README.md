# ProjectHCI

A photographer with a huge set of photos in her library wants a system to help her track the photos (which includes adding and deleting photos) and to manage sales of them. The main issue present is having to manage both one's personal photo album, and the photos that they are selling, on two separate platforms. This is very time consuming for those that wish to sell their photos, as they will have to categorize each photo on two separate platforms.


## Context
We aim to create a system where users can not only manage their pictures, but also sell and purchase photos. Users will also be able to manage the sales of the pictures that they are/were selling. Our system will exist for both users that only want to store and categorize photos, but also for those that wish to sell and purchase them.

## Requirements
-Uploading & Deleting Pictures
  -These features go hand in hand, and each are core requirements of any photo management system, and so for every user type, we decided that it falls under Must Include. A user can't manage their collection of photos without uploading and deleting them!
-Grouping Pictures
  -For an experienced user, being able to group pictures (essentially, the ability to create "albums") is absolutely necessary, as the volume of pictures that they take compared to other user types is massive. Hence, we said Must Include for this user type. For intermediate users, while they may not have such a large collection of photos, we figured that it's still quite an important requirement , and so we categorized it as Should Include. Inexperienced users likely will not care about being able to group/categorize their pictures, so we left it as Could Include. Overall, despite the inexperienced users not needing this requirement , we felt that it must be included in any photo collection management system!
-Purchasing & Selling Pictures
  -We've grouped these two categories here because they go hand in hand (buying pictures makes no sense without being able to sell them, and vice versa!). Likely, only the experienced users will need this requirement , as it is quite complex, while other user types will likely not find this useful. However, as this is a core function of our system (The solution to the problem that we were given!), we decided that it must be included.
-Tagging/Categorizing Pictures
  -This is somewhat similar to "Grouping Pictures", as only users with a large collection of photos will feel this is useful, and inexperienced users will likely not even realize that this is missing. Regardless, we found that this gives users an extra layer of control, and decided to include it. So, we decided that this falls under Should Include.
-Searching for Pictures
  -If a user is able to categorize and group their photos, then it would not make sense if they were not able to search for those photos (within their groupings/categorizations, of course!), and so we decided that this was a Must Include.
